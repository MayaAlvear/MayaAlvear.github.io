        <p class="paragraph">
            Eduardo is a bi/pansexual Mexican American in the field of evolutionary ecology and invasive <br>
            plant biology at California State University. He is currently a masters candidate studying invasive <br>
            plant genetics, and previously attended California State University San Bernardino. <br>
            Eduardo is grateful to get to work with supportive individuals in his professional and <br>
            educational spheres, and outside of work enjoys hiking, reading, and photography.

        <img src="/docs/assets/Angie.png" class="mx-auto" class="center" alt="Angie Gonzalez">

        <p class="paragraph">
            Angie is a queer Latinx Engineer at Northrop Grumman who received a dual Bachelors of Science degree <br>
            in Electrical Engineering and Physics from New York University. She is passionate about social justice and <br>
            diversity and inclusion, and volunteers for the engineering conference Out for Undergrad (O4U) as an <br>
            admissions director. Her message to young queer people who want to pursue a career in engineering is to go <br>
            for it and to embrace the sentiment that they belong in STEM, and that others in the field will adjust to the <br>
            inclusion of identities that go against norms in the field.

        <p class="paragraph">
            Victor is a gay Brazilian Geologist and PhD student in italy at the  Alma Mater Studiorum University of <br>
            Bologna. He previously studied at the Federal University of Paraná where he got his masters in Exploratory <br>
            Geology. His current work specializes in Astrobiology researching microbial carbonate precipitation in extreme <br>
            environments as a comparison to environments on Mars, although previously he has studied Geomicrobiology and <br>
            Geochemistry. Visitor first engaged with representation in academia and the sciences in his work to combat LGBTQ <br>
            oppression within his university in Brazil.

        <p class="paragraph">
            Robin Aguilar is a queer and nonbinary Latinx computational biologist and PhD candidate at University of <br>
            Washington Genome Sciences. After coming out as queer and nonbinary at a networking event at the start of <br>
            their PhD program in 2018, Robin has worked to support other scientists from marginalized communities by <br>
            writing and making art about her story and experiences, as well as establishing safe community spaces for <br>
            other trainees. Robin encourages other queer and trans scientists to realize their goals in STEM while <br>
            allowing room for self care, and in 2019 founded  the Genome Sciences Association for the Inclusion of <br>
            Marginalized Students that engages in outreach at various diversity conferences and hosts events with <br>
            diverse speakers.

            Agnaldo is gay and lives in Brazil where he is the head of the Graduate Program in Mathematics Education <br>
            at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. He has a masters in Applied and Computational Mathematics and <br>
            a PhD in Mathematics Education, and focuses on Math Education for Social Justice as he leads the research <br>
            group known as “Matematiqueer: Gender and Sexuality Studies and Mathematics Education.”  Agnaldo hopes to <br>
            use his research to help women and the LGBTQ community succeed in STEM and Mathematics in Brazil. Despite <br>
            receiving pushback for seemingly politicizing a field regarded as neutral and apolitical, he calls for gender <br>
            and LGBTQ equity in STEM and partners with non-governmental organizations on social justice projects through <br>
            MatematiQueer.
