            "What's in a Name?"
        </p>
        <p class="poem">
            I ponder my own name like a long distance sister <br>
            On paper presenting ethnic but unassuming. <br>
            At age 5 I learned how to say it correctly, its phonetics foreign through the gaps of teeth in my mouth. <br> <br>

            Soften your vowels and roll your r’s to avoid scrutiny these sounds should come naturally <br>
            It doesn’t have to be perfect but irrationally I cried because I thought that it did, <br>
            I hid behind my shame of being a no sabo kid. <br> <br>

            When I was young I had reached for this language more times than I can count only to amount <br>
            To teasing from my grandpa that was well-meaning <br>
            but the pressure of pleasing left me with more anxiety than encouragement. <br> <br>

            I forced myself to learn spanish through each critique, <br>
            what once was unfamiliar feels comforting now <br>
            Like how i remember my grandmother would speak. <br> <br>

            We never spoke in her native tongue, <br>
            And i still blame myself even though I was young; <br>
            It stung that she passed without knowing who I’d become. <br>
            She was sick and i was shy <br>
            She died before I was brave enough to try <br>
            I will never make that mistake again. <br> <br>

            I speak spanish because I’m done hiding, <br>
            And I like to think that wherever she’s residing she can hear me. <br>
            A distant call from this world reaching to her <br>
            and I’m almost sure I can feel that connection. <br> <br>

            Sometimes still I’ll stumble through phrases i have phases where this language does not want me back. <br>
            This longing for belonging within an identity that I’ve worked to be confident to claim <br>
            All the same i find comfort in my name; like a long lost sister. <br> <br>

            It connects me to my grandmother, connects me to my father <br>
            And when I say it I feel its power. <br> <br>

            My name: Maya Alvear <br> <br>
